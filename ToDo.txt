Done 1. Make a shell - that had a loop: whoosh
	—> Print prompt and wait for input
	—> Repeatedly (infinite loop)

Done 2. Add exit command
	-> the user types exit into the prompt and the shell should call exit(0)

Done 3. Design it to include pwd command
	-> the user types pwd and the shell calls getcwd() and displays result

4. Implement cd command
	—> cd without arguments changes to $HOME
	—> cd with arguments
		i. a directory name
		ii. the .. argument

5. Executing external programs
	—> Identify if a program called exists in the /bin directory
		i. print if it exists or if it does not
	b. Call an external program that has no arguments
	c. Call an external program that has arguments

Done 6. Implement path command
	-> parse arguments and set the path correctly 
	-> (we could use an array for the stored path?)

7. Defensive programming to include error messages
	a. design edge cases
	b. test them and add error handling

6. Check and document it
